# RAG vs Reranking for Llama Research Papers

This repository presents a project focused on enhancing document retrieval and ranking using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Reranking Models**. Specifically, it addresses the task of improving the retrieval and ranking of **Llama research papers**. By leveraging RAG and reranking techniques, the system aims to generate more relevant and accurate results, optimizing the process of finding the most pertinent research papers from a large corpus.

## 📚 Overview

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: RAG models combine both **retrieval** and **generation** techniques, enabling the system to search for relevant documents (e.g., research papers) and augment the response with useful content from retrieved passages. This process improves the model’s ability to generate informative, context-aware responses based on the most relevant documents.

- **Reranking**: Reranking models improve the results of an initial retrieval by reordering the top documents based on relevance and quality, enhancing the final ranking and improving the accuracy of the search.

In this project, we utilize **RAG** for document retrieval and **Reranking models** to refine the ranking of **Llama research papers**. By combining these techniques, the system enhances both the retrieval phase and the quality of the output.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Retrieves relevant documents (research papers) and generates context-aware responses.
- **Reranking**: Reorders the retrieved documents based on their relevance to the query.
- **Llama Research Papers Dataset**: The model is fine-tuned specifically for the Llama research papers dataset, making it more effective for searching academic papers.
- **Multi-step Process**: Combines retrieval, generation, and reranking for improved accuracy and relevance.
- **Extensible**: Can be adapted for other domains by changing the dataset and retraining.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset consists of a collection of **Llama research papers**, which includes abstracts, titles, and metadata associated with the papers. This dataset serves as the foundation for both the **retrieval** and **reranking** phases of the project.

You can either use publicly available Llama research papers or your own custom dataset for training and testing.
